## Auto mode
In auto mode, all text on the clipboard is converted to the selected format continuosly.

Some programs will complain if it is accessing the clipboard at the same time as this program. If this causes problems, stop the Auto mode and use the toolbar or hotkeys instead.

## Modes and buttons

## Hotkeys
Hotkeys can be set up if you click the cog wheel / settings button.

I usually go for:

|Function    |Hotkey      |
|-----------:|-----------:|
|Lower Case  |Alt+Shift L |
|Upper Case  |Alt+Shift U |
|Plain Text  |Alt+Shift P |
|Caps Lock   |Alt+Shift C |

## Toolbar
After moving the toolbar to a good place, click the â€” button to hide the border around it. Toggle "Always on top" mode with the pin icon.

## System Tray icon
There's a red "A" systray icon with with a right click menu. It has all the main conversion functions, and a way to show or hide the window.
If you double click the icon, it toggles Caps Lock, and the icon will display as an Upper or Lower case A.
